## Program verification in Visual Studio Code

As you can see, this [example from !ink v2.1.0](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/v2.1.0/examples/multisig_plain/lib.rs) has been reused
to demonstrate the analysis of a smart contract written with Rust  
from the test editor of a Smart Contract developer.

We can see the testing panel opened on the left with tests ready made available  
for leveraging the KLEE Symbolic Execution Engine.  

The Terminal output contains KLEE output, resulting from those test execution
from the SafePKT backend configured.
